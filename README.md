# Hi there 👋, I'm Krithic
Computer Vision & Generative AI Enthusiast 🤖✨  

I build smart systems that *see*, *hear*, and sometimes even *chat back*. From autonomous vehicles to voice-powered assistants, I craft production-ready AI solutions that live on the edge — literally (NVIDIA Jetson style 🛠️).  

💻 **Tech I Play With:**  
- **AI & ML:** Deep Learning, CNNs, SSD, LLMs (GPT-4, Claude 2), RAG systems, LangChain, AutoGen  
- **Programming & Frameworks:** Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, SQL, pandas, numpy  
- **Hardware & Tools:** NVIDIA Jetson Nano, CUDA, Linux Kernel, Vector Databases  
- **Voice AI:** Whisper, TTS engines, real-time speech-to-text & text-to-speech pipelines  

🚀 **What I Build:**  
- Real-time voice assistants with sub-second response times  
- Edge AI object detection for robotics & industrial analytics  
- Predictive ML pipelines for smarter industrial automation  
- AI-powered retail and customer analytics solutions  

When I'm not training models, you can find me tweaking Jetson devices or experimenting with low-latency AI pipelines.  

Let's create the future of AI together!
